I am a CS PhD Student at [Matter of Tech Lab]{https://www.matteroftechlab.org/} with [Prof. Thijs Roumen]{https://thijsroumen.eu/}, dedicated to advancing augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) technologies, my research centers on developing systems to seamlessly integrate non-informative speech such as humor, interjection words/sounds, reading poetry, etc, enhancing expressivity for individuals with speech and motor impairments.  

Areas of interest: accessibility, AAC, expressive communication, LLMs, human-AI interaction, and HCI.

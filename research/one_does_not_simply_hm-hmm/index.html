    <title>Why So Serious? Exploring Humor in AAC Through AI-Powered Interfaces</title>

    <meta name="description" content="People with speech disabilities may use speech generating devices to facilitate their speech, aka Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) technology. This technology enables practical conversation; however it remains challenging to deliver expressive and timely comments. In this paper, we study how AAC technology can facilitate such speech, through AI powered interfaces. We focus on the least predictable and most high-paced type: humorous comments.
    We conducted seven qualitative interviews with people with speech disabilities, and performed thematic analysis to gain in-depth insights in usage and challenges of AAC technology, and the role humor plays for them. We designed four simple AI powered interfaces to create humorous comments. In a user study with five participants with speech disabilities, these interfaces allowed us to study how to best support making well-timed humorous comments. We conclude with a discussion of recommendations for interface design based on both studies.

                                Fig. 1: A conversation between two AAC users. We find that backchanneling (active-listening) plays a crucial role in communication. However, here to enter text, both users engage with their devices, missing out on non-verbal cues from their interlocutor. We identify a need for better support of backchanneling for AAC, while respecting their established micro-culture.

                    Backchanneling (e.g., "uh-huh", "hmm", a simple nod) encompasses a big part of everyday communication; it is how we negotiate the turn to speak, it signals our engagement, and shapes the flow of our conversations. For people with speech and motor impairments, backchanneling is limited to a reduced set of modalities, and their Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) technology requires visual attention, making it harder to observe non-verbal cues of conversation partners. We explore how users of AAC technology approach backchanneling and create their own unique channels and communication culture. We conducted a workshop with 4 AAC users to understand the unique characteristics of backchanneling in AAC. We explored how backchanneling changes when pairs of AAC users communicate vs when an AAC user communicates with a non-AAC user. We contextualize these findings through four in-depth interviews with speech-language pathologists (SLPs). We conclude with a discussion about backchanneling as a micro‚Äëcultural practice, rethinking embodiment and mediation in AAC technology, and providing design recommendations for timely multi-modal backchanneling while respecting different communication cultures.

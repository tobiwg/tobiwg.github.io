    <title>Why So Serious? Exploring Humor in AAC Through AI-Powered Interfaces</title>

    <meta name="description" content="People with speech disabilities may use speech generating devices to facilitate their speech, aka Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) technology. This technology enables practical conversation; however it remains challenging to deliver expressive and timely comments. In this paper, we study how AAC technology can facilitate such speech, through AI powered interfaces. We focus on the least predictable and most high-paced type: humorous comments.
    We conducted seven qualitative interviews with people with speech disabilities, and performed thematic analysis to gain in-depth insights in usage and challenges of AAC technology, and the role humor plays for them. We designed four simple AI powered interfaces to create humorous comments. In a user study with five participants with speech disabilities, these interfaces allowed us to study how to best support making well-timed humorous comments. We conclude with a discussion of recommendations for interface design based on both studies.

                    Abstract
                </h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    People with disabilities that affect their speech may use speech-generating devices (SGD),
                     commonly referred to as Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) technology. 
                     This technology enables practical conversation; however, delivering expressive and timely
                      comments remains challenging. This paper explores how to extend AAC technology to support
                    a subset of humorous expressions: delivering timely humorous comments -witty remarks- 
                    through AI-powered interfaces. To understand the role of humor in AAC and the challenges
                     and experiences of delivering humor with AAC, we conducted seven qualitative interviews
                      with AAC users. Based on these insights and the lead author's firsthand experience as an
                       AAC user, we designed four AI-powered interfaces to assist in delivering well-timed 
                       humorous comments during ongoing conversations.
                    Our user study with five AAC users found that when timing is critical (e.g., delivering 
                    a humorous comment), AAC users are willing to trade agency for efficiencyâ€”contrasting 
                    prior research where they hesitated to delegate decision-making to AI.  
                    We conclude by discussing the trade-off between agency and efficiency in AI-powered 
                    interfaces, how AI can shape user intentions, and offer design recommendations for 
                    AI-powered AAC interfaces.
